**A* Pathfinding Visualization** is a tool developed using Python and the PyQt5 library, designed to visualize the A* pathfinding algorithm. Users can create custom maps, set start and end points, and then find the shortest path between these points.

### Installation Requirements
Ensure your system meets the following requirements:
- Python 3.12.0
- PyQt5 library

Install PyQt5 with this command:
```bash
pip install PyQt5
```

### Features
- **Create Custom Maps:** Adjust map size and draw obstacles.
- **Set Start and End Points:** Specify these locations on the map.
- **Use A* Algorithm:** Find the shortest path by clicking the "Start" button.
- **Heuristic Function Support:** Choose between Euclidean or Manhattan distance for path cost calculation.
- **Random Map Generation:** Ensures solvable maps.
- **Clear Map:** Reset your progress with the "Clear" button.

### Usage
1. Install necessary dependencies (refer to Installation Requirements).
2. Run the program:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
3. Create a map, draw obstacles, and set start and end points on the interface.
4. Click "Start" to run the A* algorithm and find the shortest path.
5. Observe the results and computation time in the output.

### Notes
- Pathfinding duration depends on map size and complexity.
- Use the "Clear" button to restart at any time.
- To use different heuristic functions, select from the dropdown and click "Start".
- You can also generate random maps to ensure solvability before finding paths.
